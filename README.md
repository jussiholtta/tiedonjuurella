## Tiedonjuurilla

We are Tiededruidit, a team in the Tiede, tieto ja totuus -hackathon 2019. We are on a mission to make the science behind everyday life.

Tiedonjuurilla is a collaborative learning game designed to cultivate curiosity and the joy of discovery. The goal is to discover the science that connects everyday items and makes them possible.

Players need to explain their choices to each other and learn together. Using external sources is allowed, you don't need to be an expert to play!

Join us on a journey to discover the science behind everyday life and how everything is connected.

### Gameplay

)

To start the game everyone writes down one everyday object for the game deck. Two objects are chosen randomly and a round of the game revolves around them.

The goal is to discover the science that connects these items and makes both possible. Players need to explain their choices to each other and learn together.

Using external sources is allowed, you don't need to be an expert to play!

The round continues as long as the discussion continues and people keep discovering new things. To contribute to the shared learning of everyon else in the world playing the game, share your discoveries on social media with \#tiedonjuurilla

*yes, we know the url says tiedonjuurella, my bad. Didn't have time to fix the video so we're keeping this happy accident*

## Game alternatives and contexts

The game can be played anywhere with anyone. The more diverse the group, the more likely it is that everyone will learn.

The two main contexts we were thinking while designing it were a pub with a group of friends and a class in primary school applying phenomenon based learning.

The links between the items can be anything from free association to well researched links. For us as a group of experts the best category was fields of science.

By varying the extent in which people need to justify their additions (ranging from peer reviewed meta-analysis to convincing personal argument). 

### Bar variant created post hack by Jussi (thanks to the testing crew)
Stack of ready made of (mostly) everyday objects and concepts.
1. Deal two concepts
2. The fastest to come up with a field of science that connects the two gets the pair
3. Repeat until deck runs out
4. Don't count points because everybody wins when we learn together

In related news: Jamie Oliver now officially is a field of science combining Service Design and Indiction Stoves.
