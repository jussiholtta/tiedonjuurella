## Tiedonjuurilla

We are Tiededruidit, a team in the Tiede, tieto ja totuus -hackathon 2019. We are on a mission to make the science behind everyday life.

Tiedonjuurilla is a collaborative learning game designed to cultivate curiosity and the joy of discovery. The goal is to discover the science that connects everyday items and makes them possible.

Players need to explain their choices to each other and learn together. Using external sources is allowed, you don't need to be an expert to play!

Join us on a journey to discover the science behind everyday life and how everything is connected.

### Gameplay

Two objects are chosen randomly and the game itself revolves around them.

Players need to explain their choices to each other and learn together.

Using external sources is allowed, you don't need to be an expert to play!
